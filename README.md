I’m Thejaswi M — “The SCM Owl” — a specialist in Software Configuration Management (SCM), Engineering Metrics, and Process Excellence. My mission is simple: help organizations build world-class engineering systems by combining technical discipline with data-driven clarity.

The engineering and ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) landscape is evolving faster than ever. New tools, modern DevOps pipelines, and advanced metric frameworks are redefining how software teams operate. Yet most organizations still struggle with the fundamentals: predictable delivery, clear KPIs & OKRs, reliable SCM workflows, and scalable processes.

That’s where I come in.

For over a decade, across IBM and multiple global environments, I’ve helped teams transform how they plan, build, version, measure, and deliver software.

I focus on four core areas:

🦉 1. Software Configuration Management (SCM)

I design and refine version-control strategies, branching models, Git/GitHub workflows, ClearCase modernization paths, and governance practices that reduce friction and increase engineering velocity.

📊 2. KPI & OKR Architecture

I help organizations identify the right engineering and business metrics — not more metrics. From flow efficiency to delivery predictability, I align engineering outputs with real business outcomes.

⚙️ 3. Process Excellence & Operational Optimization

Using Lean, Six Sigma, and systems thinking, I streamline workflows, eliminate waste, and create processes that scale. I’ve consistently improved efficiency, quality, and delivery performance for engineering teams of all sizes.

🎓 4. Training, Coaching & Culture Building

A world-class engineering system only works when people understand it. I conduct practical trainings on SCM, Git/GitHub, Operational KPIs/OKRs, Agile, and engineering excellence.

I emphasize collaboration, respect, inclusion, and psychological safety — because the right culture powers the right results.

My Philosophy as “The SCM Owl” — Owls are symbols of clarity, wisdom, and sharp observation. That’s how I approach engineering problems:

     ● See what others miss
     ● Simplify the complex
     ● Bring structure to chaos
     ● Enable teams to work smarter, not harder

I connect technical depth with business thinking so organizations gain not just better tools — but better outcomes.

If you’re passionate about building high-performance engineering teams, let’s connect.

I’m always happy to exchange ideas, collaborate, or contribute to meaningful improvements in the world of SCM and engineering excellence.
